To begin development, start Temporal Server:

  {cyan cd} ~/path/to/temporal/docker-compose/
  {cyan docker-compose up}

{dim.italic If you havenâ€™t run Temporal Server before, visit:
https://docs.temporal.io/docs/typescript/getting-started/}

Then, in the project directory, using two other shells, run these commands:

  {cyan npm run start.watch}
  {cyan npm run workflow.start}

After the Workflow is started, you can run any of these commands:

  {cyan npm run workflow.signal}
  {cyan npm run workflow.query}
  {cyan npm run workflow.cancel}
