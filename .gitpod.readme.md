# Welcome to the TS SDK Gitpod setup!

If you're reading this, you probably clicked on our Gitpod link:
[![Gitpod ready-to-code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-908a85?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/)

We have preconfigured Gitpod with some recommended settings (in [.gitpod.yml](/.gitpod.yml)).
When you first launch, we will open 3 terminals:

- Pane 1: Temporal Server - always running
- Pane 2: Hello World sample
  - Left: Temporal Worker - running and hot reloading
  - Right: Temporal Client - run `npm run workflow`

It takes ~3 minutes for the Docker Compose setup to start up.
Once you have it up and running (Temporal Web should show the first Workflow Execution), you can use our [Hello World Walkthrough tutorial](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/typescript/hello-world) to orient you to the sample file structure.
